libSU3
======

This is a library for calculating the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and isoscalar
factors for tensor products of representations of SU(3).

This library is based on the following two papers, which outline an algorithm
for computing the isoscalar factors:

* H. Thomas Williams
  SU3 Isoscalar Factors
  J.Math.Phys. 37 (1996) 4187-4198
  arXiv:hep-th/9509167

* Thomas A. Kaeding, H. Thomas Williams
  Program for Generating Tables of SU(3) Coupling Coefficients
  Comput.Phys.Commun. 98 (1996) 398-414
  arXiv:nucl-th/9511025

The library functions similarly to the program associated with
Kaeding and Williams. However, this library is only based on
the above two papers, and not on the original program.

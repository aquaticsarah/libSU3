       Note: The functions step_s_down_* often make steps "from" locations
       which do not correspond to valid states. In those cases, we know that
       the corresponding coefficient will always be ignored. However, in those
       cases, the coefficient is sometimes indeterminate or infinite, and this
       causes problems. Specifically, this occurs if one of k1-l1 or k2-l2 is
       zero.

       Because the coefficient is ignored in those cases, we can safely
       special-case it to be zero instead.

       In principle this can fail, in which case you need to use the exchange
       symmetries in order to calculate the values. This should never happen with
       this function, however, as isoscalars() has logic for deciding whether this
       can happen *before* it picks which ISFs to calculate.

       Note: When doing this, there are two independent choices we can make:

       * We can try to calculate the value at (k1max,l1min) or at (k1min,l1max)
         (these require different steps afterwards)

       * We can try recursion relation A or recursion relation B
         (these require the same steps afterwards)

       Each of the four combinations works in different cases, so we intelligently
       choose between them.

       Internally, we use the step_k1_up/down and step_l1_up/down functions,
       but we step "from" a non-existent state (with k1,l1 not in the valid range)
       to the state we want. This works because 'isoscalar_array' allows us to
       request (certain) non-existent states and just returns 0 for the coupling
       coefficient. This is exactly what we need for the stepping to work properly.

Miscellaneous documentation
===========================

This directory is for various bits and pieces related to libSU3,
but where there was no obvious place to write it into the code.
This includes, for example, derivations of various results used
in the code, and our overall phase conventions. There are various
smaller results documented in the code next to where they are used.

The intention is that this directory should be read in combination
with the papers referenced in the overall README in order to help
understand the algorithm, and the code comments should help when working
with that particular bit of code.
